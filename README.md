# Rush Hour
A solver and visualization of the game Rush Hour for the Heuristieken course. 

## Usage

In `main` the program will run the `random` and `breadth first search` algorithm. You can run the program in the terminal with the following command: 

```
python main.py 1
```

The number represents one of the seven boards the algoritm can solve. In order to have the algorithm solve one of the other seven boards, enter a different number between 1 - 7.  


### Prerequisites (TODO)

The code is written in `Python 2.7`. Running it in Python 3 might cause problems. Running the program requires installation of `Matplotlib`. If this is not yet installed on your computer, you can find installation instructions for your operating system [here](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).

```
Give examples of how to check if matplotlib is installed
